Major newspapers in the region include the Oneida Daily Dispatch, Syracuse Post-Standard, Auburn Citizen, Ithaca Journal, and Utica Observer-Dispatch, as well as the alternative newsweekly Syracuse New Times. The major colleges and universities in the region include Hamilton College, Cornell University, Le Moyne College, SUNY Oswego, Colgate University, SUNY Cortland, Utica College, Ithaca College, Syracuse University and the SUNY ESF. The region is served by several television stations based in Syracuse and Utica. Note: Tompkins County and Cortland County are often considered part of the region in New York State called the Southern Tier; the ski country demarcation line runs through Cortland County. Tompkins County, which features Ithaca at the end of Cayuga Lake, is also considered part of the Finger Lakes. Oneida County and Herkimer County are often considered part of the region in NYS called the Mohawk Valley, although the \"Central New York\" and \"Mohawk Valley\" definitions overlap and neither definition is mutually exclusive. Therefore Tompkins County, Cortland County, Oneida County and Herkimer County are only Central New York in the broader sense of the phrase \"Central New York\". Only Onondaga County, Cayuga County, Oswego County and Madison County are always considered \"Central New York\". The New York State Department of Transportation defines the Central/Eastern region as including the counties of Albany, Broome, Chenango, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Fulton, Greene, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster, and Washington, but does not commit itself to a definition of Central New York per se." , "alt-labels" : [ ] , "relation" :  null  , "label" : "Central New York" , "alt-descriptions" : [ ] , "type" : "" , "lang" : "en" , "uri" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_New_York"} , { "description" : "Cayuga Lake (" , "alt-labels" : [ { "val" : "Lago Cayuga" , "lang" : "it"} , { "val" : "Lago Cayuga" , "lang" : "pt"}] , "relation" :  null  , "label" : "Cayuga Lake" , "alt-descriptions" : [ { "val" : "Lago Cayuga" , "lang" : "it"} , { "val" : "Lago Cayuga" , "lang" : "pt"}] , "type" : "Place,BodyOfWater,Lake" , "lang" : "en" , "uri" : "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cayuga_Lake"} , { "description" : "United States (country)" , "alt-labels" : [ ] , "relation" :  null  , "label" : "United States" , "alt-descriptions" : [ ] , "type" : "Place" , "lang" : "en" , "uri" : "http://sws.geonames.org/6252001/"} , { "description" : "Ithaca, United States (city) \nLatitude: 42.44063 \nLongitude: -76.49661" , "alt-labels" : [ { "val" : "Itaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "Ítaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaque"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "伊薩基島"} , { "val" : "Ítaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "イタキ島"} , { "val" : "Итака (остров)"} , { "val" : "Ithaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"}] , "relation" :  null  , "label" : "Ithaca" , "alt-descriptions" : [ { "val" : "Itaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "Ítaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaque"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "伊薩基島"} , { "val" : "Ítaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"} , { "val" : "イタキ島"} , { "val" : "Итака (остров)"} , { "val" : "Ithaca"} , { "val" : "Ithaka"}] , "type" : "Place" , "lang" : "en" , "uri" : "http://sws.geonames.org/5122432/"} , { "description" : "A glacier is a large persistent body of ice. Originating on land, a glacier flows slowly due to stresses induced by its weight. The crevasses and other distinguishing features of a glacier are due to its flow. Another consequence of glacier flow is the transport of rock and debris abraded from its substrate and resultant landforms like cirques and moraines. A glacier forms in a location where the accumulation of snow and sleet exceeds its ablation over many years, often decades or centuries.

It is a private land-grant university which receives funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. Cornell was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White as a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where admission was offered irrespective of religion or race. Its founders intended that the new university would teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge&mdash;from the classics to the sciences and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study. \" Cornell offers programs in liberal arts, engineering, agriculture, hotel administration, law, medicine, and city and regional planning. The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus&mdash;for example, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering&mdash;with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. Cornell is one of two private land grant universities, and its seven undergraduate colleges include three state-supported statutory or contract colleges. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. As New York's land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of the state. Cornell counts more than 255,000 living alumni, 28 Rhodes Scholars and 41 Nobel laureates affiliated with the university as faculty or students.
