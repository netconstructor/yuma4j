# TODOs

* Make search results page URL bookmarkable
* Pagination in annotation list views
* Re-enable RDF publishing
* Revise feed API
* 'Dump database' and 'Dump to RDF' feature (in the admin section)
* Implement index-based operations in HibernateAnnotationStore using Hibernate Search
* The 'created' and 'modified' properties should be set by the system, not via JSON!
* Unit testing: Hibernate tests are now all in one method - split up into one test method per
  HibernateAnnotationStore method
* Unit testing: test annotation tree setup
* Unit testing: test annotation tree DB retrieval
* Wicket tooling for Web tests?
